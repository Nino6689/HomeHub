## Screenshot Tips

**For website screenshots:**
1. Use browser DevTools (F12) > Device Toolbar to capture responsive views
2. Desktop: 1920x1080 or 1440x900
3. Mobile: iPhone 14 Pro (393x852) or similar

**For app screenshots:**
1. Export from Figma/design files if available
2. Or capture from actual device/emulator

**Optimization:**
- Save as PNG for quality, or WebP for smaller file size
- Compress with tools like TinyPNG before uploading
- Recommended max width: 1200px for web display
